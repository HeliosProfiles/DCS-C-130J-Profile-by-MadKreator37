### ABOUT

### Minimum Helios version required: 1.6.6170.2



This profile was designed and created by myself, in close collaboration with BlueFin. All parts were cut and modified from the 3d model of the C-130J cockpit, texture files or replicas were designed and created from scratch. Every piece used is specific to the C-130J.  The hope is to bring you the most complete, visually appealing and easy to use profile for the C-130J for DCS World that we could.  There are several added functions in the profile, such as buttons for the ramp controls, cargo, rearm/refuel window, briefing menu, f-keys, kneeboard functions etc.

*NOTE*: The added functions:  F-keys Esc, Rearm, Briefing, kneeboard etc buttons require the default DCS keybindings for them to work properly. If you have altered any of these then some functions may not work as intended.

### Very special thanks to @BlueFinBima for all of his contributions including the massive, in-depth interface, custom made controls, toolbox items, repository help, endless hours of coding and more! If you like the profile, make sure to thank him as I would not have been able to do this without his tireless effort and expertise!

### Known Issues
Using this profile will break MP IC. However, since most all viewports are native to the module you can disable the C-130 patches in Helios Editor- DCS Additional Viewports- Details(Advanced) to make it IC compliant.
By doing so you will lose the following displays:
- All 9 "Fuel Set Quantity" displays.. ( Not the actual fuel in the tanks though)
- The Air Conditioning temp displays
- Battery Voltage Display
- Differential Pressure Display
- And it will disable the exportable Arc-210 Viewport


### Notes

-Due to the wide range of displays, monitors, TV's and tablets,  I cannot guarantee exact brightness levels or color accuracy results from user to user. This is not something I have any control of. If you have visual issues (too bright or too dark etc)  please calibrate your display and/or adjust settings in your GPU's software, brightness, contrast, sharpness, gamma, digital vibrance etc.(highly recommended anyway). It will probably enhance all other profiles as well. During testing, the profile was used and shown on multiple displays, and types,  to rule out any "game breaking" visuals but it is impossible for me to account for every scenario.
